GO TO https://ehrrsn7.github.io/Asteroids/ TO RUN THE GAME.

Just experimenting with code to make Asteroids (Atari) using JavaScript.
Since I don't know JavaScript at all, I used this tutorial for help.

# UPDATE:

I used node.js to implement this code. I'll work on implementing this later, but I used this to host my code on my github site based on this repo, located in: ehrrsn7.github.io/Asteroids/index.html
** it is not currently working, I need to change my root folder in the settings for it to work in github pages.
